### 🌿 Beyond the Code

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me in the woods photographing wildlife, identifying native plants, or contributing to open-source science and climate initiatives. My lab training in chemistry taught me precision, experimentation, and resilience—skills I bring to every line of code.
